# Automated end to end tests written in JavaScript and Cypress

This is an example of test automation for login functionality for https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ using Cypress with implemented Page Object Model.

## I designed five login tests:

- successful login with valid username and valid password
- unsuccessful login with valid username and empty password
- unsuccessful login with valid username and invalid password
- unsuccessful login with empty userename and valid password
- unsuccessful login with invalid username and valid password
